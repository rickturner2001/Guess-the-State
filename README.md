# Guess the State

This is a simple game I used to play here: [https://www.geoguessr.com/seterra/en/vgp/3003](https://www.geoguessr.com/seterra/en/vgp/3003)

I thought I’d write my own with React and Typescript, just for fun. This isn’t a well developed game by any stretch of your immagination. Regardless, it does work and is pubblicly available
